                <h2 id="headline">Early Years</h2>
                
                <p>Arthur George Gaston was born in Demopolis, Alabama on July 4, 1892 to Tom and Rosa Mcdonald Gaston. Gaston would spend his childhood living with his grandmother due to the fact that his father, who was a railway worker, died in an accident shortly after he was born and  his mother was employed as a cook for A.B. Loveman, a wealthy Jewish business man, 25 miles away in Greensboro. He later moved to Birmingham in 1905 at the age of 13 to live with his mother and the Loveman family. Loveman, who was a successful entrepreneur and investor in his own right and whom owned the largest department store in the state, would largely influence the young Gaston to later form his own chain of businesses.</p>
                
                <p>Gaston's mother enrolled him into the Tuggle Institute, a privately run charitable school for African Americans. The institute taught Booker T. Washington's industrial education philosophy which emphasized the skilled trades and business. Booker T. Washington would often speak here on occasion to motivate and inspire the youth. Washington quickly became a role model to the young Gaston. Inspired by these messages of individual initiative Gaston would leave school with only a tenth grade education to work odd jobs here and there. Gaston enlisted in the army in 1913 due to the fact that he was unable to find prosperous business opportunity. He was assigned to the all-black Ninety-second infintry division which deployed overseas to Cherbourg, France to fight in World War I in 1917. While overseas fighting in the war he was able to send money home to pay the mortgage on his first real estate investment property in Birmingham.</p>

                <h2>Business Development</h2>

                <p>Gaston began his entrepreneurial career with the launch of the Booker T. Washington Burial Society in 1923. He observed that there was no place offering a proper burial service for the miners. Widows would collect donations from the mines and local churches. So he started asking the workers to contribute 25 cents a week to ensure a proper burial service should they pass. The business grew quickly especially due to the fact that local black ministers would send their members to the society as well.</p>

                <p>In 1932 Gaston started the Booker T. Washington Insurance Co. which provided life, health, and accident insurance. Later Gaston increased his streams of revenue by adding burial insurance, undertaking, making caskets and selling burial plots. With a need for more skilled black workers in the field Gaston would then go on to establish the Booker T. Washington business school in 1939.</p>

                <p>Gaston formed many more companies over the course of his lifetime. Companies such as Vulcan Realty and Investment Co., the A.G. Gaston Home for Senior Citizens, WEN-FM and WAG-AM radio stations, and S&G Public Relations. Gaston was very keen on finding and filling needs to uplift the local community. In 1957 Gaston noticed that blacks were having a hard time obtaining loans from white banks so he founded the Citizens Federal Savings and Loan Association. It was the first black-owned financial institution in Birmingham. And at the age of 94 Gaston added A.G. Gaston Construction Co. to his business empire.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>Gaston is also a little known but major contributor to the civil rights movement. He would use his wealth and influence to support the movement even though at times he did not entirely agree with it's methods. Gaston was as fierce in fighting segregation as he was in building businesses but he preferred negotiating with the white business leaders of Birminghamas as opposed to protesting. This would result in the more radical civil rights leaders to accuse Gaston of being an "Uncle Tom." Gaston feared the negative consequences that would result as an effect of the protest. He firmly believed that wanting to spare children and save lives was far more important than conducting demonstrations and that negotitions could take place without confrontation. Gaston also served on on the Committee of 100, a biracial group of Birmingham business men committed to desegregating the city by less public means. He understood that there was a way to empower the black community economically by navigating the white power structure.</p>

                <p>During his time Gaston was considered the richest African-American in the country with an estimated net worth of $130 million, by todays standards. Gaston received many awards and accolades during his life time. One of which being the "Entrepreneur of the Century" award in 1992 granted to him by Black Enterprise Magazine. He would also engage in philanthropic endeavors such as donating $50,000 to establish the A.G. Gaston Boys and Girls Club in Birmingham. He would visit the club many times to inspire the black youth with his story. One of Gaston's primary motives was to inspire entrepreneurship within the black community. Individual freedom and rights of others were foundational to Gaston's thinking. He envisioned a world in which black Americans were sovereign, morally free and equal. He created his businesses in part to design platforms to teach African Americans about business and finance since this was largely unavailable to the black community. His contributions to ensure economic freedom and civil rights were essential to his success and his legacy.</p>
